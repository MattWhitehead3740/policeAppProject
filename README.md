# policeAppProject
Web application for multiple resources that police officers commonly use / need.

My initial approach to attacking this problem is through the use of common web development strategies. I intend to make it a web application because it can be ran from almost any device with internet connection and I won't have to develop 4 different versions of it in 4 different languages.
